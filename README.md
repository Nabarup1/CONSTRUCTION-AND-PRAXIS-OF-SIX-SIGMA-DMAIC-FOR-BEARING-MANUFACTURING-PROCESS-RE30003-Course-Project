## Introduction
In today's fiercely competitive market, maintaining peak performance while curbing costs stands paramount. This project utilizes the Six Sigma DMAIC methodology to enhance the bearing manufacturing process at Kirloskar Oil Engine Ltd. The primary aim is to refine quality and minimize manufacturing setbacks using Statistical Quality Control (SQC) methods.

## Methodology
### DMAIC Phases:
1. **Define**: Identified critical defects affecting the bearing manufacturing process through Pareto analysis.
2. **Measure**: Conducted a process capability analysis to assess the current performance levels and identify areas for improvement.
3. **Analyze**: Utilized fishbone analysis to pinpoint the root causes of defects and performed systematic experimentation using an L27 orthogonal array.
4. **Improve**: Implemented optimization efforts that led to significant improvements in critical quality attributes.
5. **Control**: Ensured sustained process improvements and maintained enhanced process capability levels.

## Key Findings
- Identified nine critical defects that significantly influenced rejection rates.
- Enhanced 'Finish wall thickness at crown' through targeted improvements.
- Achieved substantial improvements in process capability indices (Cp and Cpk).
- Utilized advanced statistical methods and tools, including Taguchi's robust design methodology, to drive operational excellence.

## Conclusion
The integration of Six Sigma DMAIC methodology with Taguchi's robust design has proven to be highly effective in bolstering the process competence of the bearing manufacturing process. This approach not only mitigates rejection rates but also ensures sustained operational efficacy and heightened customer contentment.
